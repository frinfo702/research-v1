# Paper Presentation Guide (EN)

## Quick Questions

- Time limit and expected slide count
- Audience expertise level
- Required sections (background, method, experiments, related work)
- Goal: "Who should understand what, and to what depth?"

## Goal Definition

- Write a single sentence of what the audience should be able to do after the talk
- Example: "Lab members can explain the assumptions and when to use this method"

## Story Template

1. Problem setup
2. Prior work limitations (gap)
3. Core idea (what is new)
4. Mechanism (intuition -> equations/details)
5. Experimental evidence (what improved and by how much)
6. Limitations and future work
7. Takeaway

## Equation Handling Checklist

- Provide intuition first
- Define variables and assumptions
- Explain where it comes from (derivation or design choice)
- State what it enables or why it matters

## Figure Handling Checklist

- What question does this figure answer?
- Explain axes, comparisons, and conditions
- Summarize the takeaway in one sentence

## Avoid Literal Translation

- Do not translate sentences; convert to "claim -> evidence -> implication"
- Do: state goal, assumptions, decisions, and constraints explicitly
- Example:
  - Original: "We minimize X by Y"
  - Rewrite: "Goal is X. Under assumption Y, we minimize Z to achieve it"
